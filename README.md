This is a collection of folders and files to be used as a template for the creation of reports. Specifically, this was designed for the Alliance Progress Report, but it can be used for any.

The template includes the following folders:
- analyses
- archive
- data
- documents
- images
- source

Update the README files in the project as you work through the investigation

If using GitHub, a README file might be autmotically created. Copy the information in this file to that file, and archive this file.
