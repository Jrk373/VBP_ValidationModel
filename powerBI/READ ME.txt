So this is the folder that houses the materials for the PowerBI dashboards.

But, which files to use for what?

What do we need?

1. Dashboard for the VBP QR results
	a. Shows compliance percentage - VBP_RepCombValidation
	b. Shows proportions of eligibles
	c. Generates gap list 

2. Member list for inpatient claims
	a. IP Claims summary

3. VBP > Claims validation match
	a. data_cat_2023-11-30_validationMatrix

4. VBP > Claims Validation Match + Recombine with ALL potential inpatient claims
	a. data_eval_ValMat_All.csv
	b. Then, to recombine a compliance indicator
		1. Using the "Compliance" table,
			a. create an indicator for Yes/No/Both for each measure
				1. Maybe "Is FUH7 Compiant", etc.

Need to diversify the outputs folder
